## ğŸš€ Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/uadinaa/DARE-django-final.git
```

### 2. Backend (Django)

1. Go into the backend folder:
    ```bash
    cd backend
    ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate        # Linux/macOS
   venv\Scripts\activate           # Windows
   ```

3. Install Python dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Apply database migrations:
   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

4. Create a superuser (optional):
   ```bash
   python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```

5. Run the Django server:
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

Django is now running at: [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).

6. Open the [http://localhost:8000/admin](http://localhost:8000/admin). There you must:
- Open the 'Categories' model
- Add a single entry. For example: 'default'
- Save it.

This is done because making posts requires selecting a category of the post.

Now open a new terminal window and proceed with frontend setup.
