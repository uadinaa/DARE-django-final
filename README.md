```

### 2. Backend (Django)

1. Go into the backend folder:
    ```bash
    cd backend
    ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate        # Linux/macOS
   venv\Scripts\activate           # Windows
   ```

3. Install Python dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Apply database migrations:

   python manage.py migrate
   ```

5. Create a superuser (optional):
   ```bash
   python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```

6. Run the Django server:
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

Django is now running at: [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).

7. Configure Categories:

   Access the Django admin panel to set up a category:

   1. Open [http://localhost:8000/admin](http://localhost:8000/admin) in your browser.

   3. Navigate to the **Categories** section.
   4. Add a new category (e.g., **"default"**) and save it.

   > **Note:** This is necessary because creating posts requires selecting a category. Ensure **at least one category** exists before proceeding.
